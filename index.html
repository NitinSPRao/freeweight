  <h2>Your training is scattered. It doesn't have to be.</h2>
  <p>A spreadsheet for your program. A calculator for percentages. A group chat for check-ins. The Notes app for your maxes. A photo of the whiteboard for today's session.</p>
  <p>Sound familiar? FreeWeight replaces the patchwork with a single platform — purpose-built for strength training.</p>

<section class="section who-its-for">
  <h2>Whether you train alone or coach a team of 60.</h2>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>You train solo</h3>
    <p>and you want a better system than screenshots and spreadsheets. FreeWeight tracks your maxes, calculates your percentages, and shows your progress over time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>You train with a crew</h3>
    <p>a few friends running a cycle together, a college club team, or a gym community. FreeWeight gives you a shared feed, PRs on the board, and everyone on the same page.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>You coach athletes</h3>
    <p>from a handful to a full roster. Write individualized programs under one umbrella plan, push updates instantly, and see who's training and who's not.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>You're just getting started</h3>
    <p>new to the barbell or coming from another sport. Pick a built-in program, follow the plan, and let FreeWeight handle the math. Everyone starts somewhere.</p>
  </div>

<section class="section how-it-works">
  <h2>One place to program, track, and share.</h2>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>Program it.</h3>
    <p>Build training blocks, set percentages off real maxes, and customize by athlete — or pick from built-in templates like 5/3/1, GZCLP, and Starting Strength. No more spreadsheet formulas.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>Track it.</h3>
    <p>Log your lifts in seconds. See your maxes, your history, your trajectory. Progress should feel good before it looks good.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>Share it.</h3>
    <p>A team feed for PRs, milestones, and daily sessions. Not clout — just the work.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why FreeWeight?</h2>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>vs. Google Sheets / Notes app</h3>
    <p>Sheets work until you're managing percentages across a 12-week cycle — or sharing updates with 20 athletes. FreeWeight does what sheets do, minus the friction, plus the community.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>vs. Strong / Hevy / Strava</h3>
    <p>Those are logging apps. They record what you did. FreeWeight programs what you should do next, auto-calculates your working weights, and connects you to your coach or training partners.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>vs. Volt / TeamBuildr / TrueCoach</h3>
    <p>Enterprise coaching platforms start at $200+/year. FreeWeight is free and built for everyone — from a college club team to a group of friends running a training cycle.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<div class="divider"></div>

<section class="section social-proof">
  <h2>Built by people who train.</h2>
  <p>We're competitive lifters, college athletes, and strength coaches who got tired of stitching tools together. FreeWeight is the platform we wished existed — so we built it.</p>

  <div class="testimonials">
    <blockquote>"As few buttons to push as possible." <cite>— Club team coach</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote>"I want to see progress go up." <cite>— College athlete</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Fun and easy to use, but with an edge." <cite>— Beta tester</cite></blockquote>
